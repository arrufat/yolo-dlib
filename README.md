# Yolo implemented with dlib

A simple Yolo implementation using the dlib deep learning API.

This is a WIP, it still doesn't learn anything...

UPDATE: this repository is now archived, a working version of the YOLO loss has already been [merged](https://github.com/davisking/dlib/pull/2376) in dlib.
